# TTT2
A recode of the popular Garry's Mod gamemode, Trouble in Terrorist Town.

## Description
Often, I've been frustrated reading through some of the TTT code (no offense, Bad King), wondering "Why is the gamemode set up this way?", or "An update has introduced a better way of doing this.", or even "THREE SPACE INDENTATION?!!" These frustrations of mine have grown to the point where I believe I can create a solid TTT clone in my own style of coding.

## Features
Why are you even reading this? The gamemode is far from being finished.

## Credit
Of course, credit goes to Bad King Urgrain (svdm) for the concept of TTT and a fair amount of code snippets.
